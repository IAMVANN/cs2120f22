  - relations
  -- membership predicates (on pairs of values)
  -- domain, domain of definition, co-domain, range
  -- properties of relations
  -- total is when every element in the domain is in the domain of definition
  --Surjective - the range is the entire codomain; the codomain version of total

    - injectivity - one to one
    - bijectivity - 
    what does it mean to mean single valued
    - cannot have an element in a domain have 2 outputs
    - a domain can only have 1 ouptut; (doesn't mean 2 domains can't have the same output)

    -- inductive data definitions
    -- induction axioms (for enumerated types and ‚Ñï)
    -- definition of recursive functions
    -- construction of proofs by induction
